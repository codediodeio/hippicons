# HippIcons - A Hipp Icon Font for the Web

HippIcons is an open source icon font and CSS toolkit that includes over 400 stylish glyphs. It is a drop-in alternative to [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for those times you want stand out from the crowd. 

# Why?

We love the developer-friendliness of FontAwesome, but many of our projects just have a different feel, so we created our own icon font from scratch. Much like a different website skin or theme, you should be able to use HippIcons to completely change the feel of your app without dealing with missing icons, different class names, etc. 

# Design

Each icon is designed on a 32 pixel grid and they look excellent on all modern devices. They are not pixel perfect, just as pixel perfect as possible. We feel just fine sacrificing some pixel perfection for the right design because its completely unnoticeable on modern device screens. 

In comparison to FontAwesome, HippIcons are laid-back, a bit more curvaceous, enigmatic at times, and just different in subtle (but important) ways. 

# Usage

First, include the CSS and fonts files into your project. (CDN hosting coming soon…) 

HippIcons behaves exactly like FontAwesome, but uses `hi` as the class name (instead of `fa`). The class names are almost universally the same, so all you need to do is change the markup in your existing project and voilà. 

**Change:**

`<i class=“fa fa-eye fa-2x”></i>`

**To:**

`<i class=“hi hi-eye hi-2x”></i>`
